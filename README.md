# Travel photo journal
Photo journal website for my trip in SE Asia.
It's using a grunt template to automate a few tasks and a number of plugins and libraries like photoswipe, moment.js, masonry and leaflet.js.

It's been tested on most common mobile devices and modern browsers (ie9+).

At some point in the future it will be converted to a wordpress or Bolt cms theme.

You can find instructions to get the local server up and running in the readme.txt
